This is an image processing project.
It applies quantization on a digital images. The requirements of the project was to implement minimum spanning tree but that was too slow because the number of edges is too large to cosntruct a fully connected graph from image then construct MST, even Prim's Algorithm was too slow. So we applied the K-mean Clustering Algorithm and the project became so fast.
